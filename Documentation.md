#Documentation

This application is a web-based tool that helps to generate a quick inventory and vulnerability assessment of a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. The tool is developed using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.

#app.py

This file contains the main Flask application that serves different routes and renders corresponding HTML templates. The following routes are defined:

- / (index): Renders the homepage (index.html).
- /inventory: Runs the inventory.py script and redirects to the /inventory_report route.
- /inventory_report: Renders the inventory.html file generated by the inventory.py script.
- /vulnerabilities: Runs the vulnerability.py script and redirects to the /vulnerability_report route.
- /vulnerability_report: Renders the vulnerability.html file generated by the vulnerability.py script.
- /contact: Renders the contact page (contact.html).
- /recbucket: Renders the recommendation bucket page (recbucket.html).

#inventory.py

This script gathers information about Compute Engine instances, buckets, VPCs, and firewall rules in a GCP project. It uses the gcloud command-line tool and gsutil to retrieve data and stores the data in a CSV file (inventory.csv). Then, it generates an HTML file (inventory.html) to visualize the data.

#vulnerability.py

This script checks for public-facing buckets, instances using default service accounts, and vulnerable firewall rules in a GCP project. It uses gsutil and gcloud command-line tools to retrieve data and stores the data in a CSV file (vulnerabilities.csv). Then, it generates an HTML file (vulnerability.html) to visualize the data.

#index.html

This file contains the main HTML template for the homepage. It consists of buttons for running inventory and vulnerability checks, and links to the recommendation and contact pages. A JavaScript function showLoadingBar is used to display a loading bar while the inventory and vulnerability scripts are executed.

#Running the application

Ensure that Python 3.x and the Flask library are installed.
Ensure that the gcloud and gsutil command-line tools are installed and authenticated.
Run app.py using Python.
Open the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your web browser.
After completing these steps, you should see the homepage of the application. Click the "INVENTORY" and "VULNERABILITIES" buttons to generate and view the respective reports.
